# CS320 Portfolio Project

I can assure that my code program is software is functional and secure by understanding the functionality and the security of code. This is done by understanding the language that I'm programming in, but also understanding basic coding principles that are important to functional and secure code. Ensuring that i'm using the correct algorithm, and that when i implement it i don't have a stack overflow, or a buffer overflow when i'm calling an array. By doing this i'm preventing some kind of injection into the reading and writing to the array. I can interpret user needs by understanding what the user actually wants. So asking questions to understand the users requirements and if I don't understand something asking a more direct question that allows them to further describe their wants and needs. I can then make a work in progress and show the user to ensure that that's what they're asking for. I approached designing software by starting with an idea. I expand to that idea into different needs and wants that would be suitable for the application or piece of code that i'm writing. I then use a diagram such as an UML diagram to layout different functions and the overall system design of what I am trying to accomplish. And then start to incrementally build what I am designing. After each important step i test and then incorporate that into the code and I do this until I have a completed project.
